# These are some of the programs i made during the start of sem 1 of my college

### Language used : C
### Compiler used : MinGW gcc compiler
________
Due to the use of MinGw compiler and mostly compiling my programs in linux environment i wont be using conio.h so any underlying function like clrscr() and getch() wont be used in these programs.
